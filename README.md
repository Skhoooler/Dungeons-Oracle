# Overview

This app provides tabletop Game Masters with tools to better run their games. It allows a user to add information about their players and other non-player characters and keep track of them throughout the game. The goal of this project is to help me learn mobile app development in Dart using Flutter. I was able to achieve a good grasp of the language through this project, although it is not yet complete. In the completed app, the user will be able to create a new game, and add their players. The game and player data will be saved and stored in a database to be used in the future. When in a game, the user will be able to see all of their players and non-player characters in one screen. When a battle happens, they will be able to see what order the players and non-player characters will act. Although it is not yet complete, I hope to continue development of it and complete it in the near future.

# Development Environment

This app was written in Android Studio using Dart and the Flutter framework. I attempted to use the SQFLite, path_provider, and async libraries to add database functionality to my app but it did not work as intended, and will be implemented in a future sprint (a database sprint). I did not use any other external libraries besides those three.
